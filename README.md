**CodeClause Internship Projects**
Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I completed during my internship at CodeClause. This repository includes three distinct projects: a Background Generator, a Countdown App, and a Music Platform App. Each project is built using React and other web technologies.

**Projects**
**Background Generator**
A web application that allows users to create and customize their own backgrounds using various design options. Users can select colors, gradients, and patterns to generate unique background designs.

**Countdown App**
An application designed to create countdown timers for various events. Users can set a specific date and time, and the app will display a live countdown until the event occurs.
